# About the project
This was a TOP (the odin project) project made with ReactJS and a backend (firebase), the objetive was to integrate the backend in the game in someway, in this case it was integrated in the ranks, where it will get all the data and sort them to after render it all. The game is simple to play, all you need is to find Waldo and click on him, after that a box will show to you write your name, and then it will send all the info to the firebase (your name and your time).
